# ColorStop Client

Create the perfect color palette for your project or get inspired by popular color palettes created by other users!

This repo is the front-end client, built in React. You can see the app live at [https://colorstop-client.vercel.app](https://colorstop-client.vercel.app)

I suggest you create an account so you can upload palettes and save them on your account. But, if you just want to view what the website looks like and browse palettes, you can do so without an account.

## Introduction

ColorStop is the essential tool for creating and exploring color palettes. Create the perfect color palette, even if you are not skilled in design. Press 'Randomize!' on the Palette Maker to randomly generate color palettes until you find the perfect colors for you! ColorStop has a huge collection of color palettes that are well organized and ready to be used!
